            <h3>Jan 10, 2026</h3>
            <p>This blog post provides an overview of my recent science fair project titled "Canadian Forest Fires and Air Quality in Canadian Cities." The project investigates the correlation between wildfire burn areas in Canada and the frequency of unhealthy PM2.5 air quality days in Toronto over a 20-year period from 2003 to 2023.</p>
            <p>Using data from the Canadian National Fire Database and Environment Canada's air quality monitoring stations, I analyzed how increasing wildfire activity, driven by climate change, has impacted urban air quality. The findings highlight the significant influence of wildfires on public health, even in cities located far from the fire zones.</p>
            <p>I've also started work on my own custom projection model to predict when a specific city will be hit with high values of PM2.5 particles, which could help alert people with asthma or other medical conditions to stay inside that daya.</p>
            <p>For a detailed exploration of the hypothesis, methodology, results, and conclusions, please visit the full project website linked below:</p>
