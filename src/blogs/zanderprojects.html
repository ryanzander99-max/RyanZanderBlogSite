            <p>To practice my web development skills partically in HTML and CSS, I made this website. This webstie also demonstrates current projects I am working on, and will be linked in my official website. This site makes it easy to view current projects and get more information on them.</p>
            <p>I used HTML and CSS to code the site primarily, while also using Vercel to deploy it onto the web. This website took me around seven or eight hours to build fully, and was inspired by the website linked below:</p>
